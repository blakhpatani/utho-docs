## Kubernetes Information

The header section of the management page provides crucial information about your Kubernetes cluster, including:

![1718885697707](image/_index/1718885697707.png)

* **Name:** The unique identifier or label assigned to your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Datacenter Location (DC Location):** The geographical region where your Kubernetes cluster is deployed.
* **Master IP:** The IP address of the master node in your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Status:** The current operational status of your Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Running, Stopped, Error).

### Functionalities

The header section also includes several key functionalities to manage your Kubernetes cluster:

* **Download Kubernetes File:** Allows you to download the configuration file for your Kubernetes cluster. This file is essential for accessing and managing the cluster using kubectl or other tools.
* **Start Kubernetes Service:** Initiates the Kubernetes services if they are currently stopped.
* **Stop Kubernetes Service:** Stops the Kubernetes services, effectively pausing all operations within the cluster.
